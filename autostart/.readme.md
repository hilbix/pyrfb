# pyrfb autostart directory

`$HOME/autostart/` is a special property of https://github.com/hilbix/ptybuffer/
which allows autostarts via `cron` which can be easily controlled from commandline
later on.

This here is a snippet, where you can create such autostarts
for `pyrfb` semiautomatically.

To configure the number of screens, just do

	ln -ns --relative . "$HOME/autostart/pyrfb";
	./.setup number

This creates entries which are then used to automatically start the services for the screens.
(Note that `$HOME/bin/autostart.sh` must be configured to run from `cron`,
you find how to do that in `ptybuffer`.)

The screens are expected to be VNCs listening on port `5900+NR` on `127.0.0.1` without passwords,
see file `.pyrfb`.

Examples how to setup these VNC ports:

- On KVM, you can set the port of the VNC type video access, listening on `localhost`.
- `vncserver -SecurityTypes None,TLSNone -geometry 1280x1024 -fg :1` for port `5901`.
- `socat -d -d tcp-listen:5902,bind=127.0.0.1,reuseaddr,fork exec:'ssh vnc2host -W 127.0.0.1\:5902'
- You can start the latter with scripts in `$HOME/autostart/` easily.
